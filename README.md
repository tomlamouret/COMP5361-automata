# COMP5361-automata

**COMP 5361 Discrete Structures and Formal Languages**

1. Use the PySimpleAutomata-software to write a program that takes as input a transition table for a DFA or NFA A, and outputs the transition diagram for A.

2. Write a Python program that takes as input the transition table for an NFA A (no Îµ-transitions) and outputs the transition table and diagram for a DFA B, such that L(A) = L(B).
